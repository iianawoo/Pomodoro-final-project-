  Pomodoro Timer Requirements
Easy:
Create a basic timer that counts down from 25 minutes.
Provide a reset button to start a new session.
Medium:
Allow users to customize the work and break intervals.
Show notifications (visual or audio) when the session ends.
Track the number of completed Pomodoro sessions.
Hard:
Add a progress chart that shows completed sessions over time.
Store session data in a backend database.
Implement a "long break" after a set number of sessions.
 All above is done.
